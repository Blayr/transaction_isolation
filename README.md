# transaction_isolation

Adds support for setting transaction isolation level in ActiveRecord in a database agnostic way.

## Example

    ActiveRecord::Base.isolation_level( :serializable ) do
      # your code
    end

## Installation

Add this to your Gemfile:

    gem 'transaction_isolation'

Then run:

    bundle

## Features

 * Setting transaction isolation level (:read_uncommitted, :read_committed, :repeatable_read, :serializable)
 * Auto-reverting to the original isolation level after the block
 * Database agnostic
 * MySQL2, [soon also PostgreSQL and SQLite3] database connection adapters supported
 * Use it in your Rails application or a standalone ActiveRecord-based project

## Real world example

When implementing a table-based job queue you should ensure that only one worker process can pop a particular job from the queue.
Wrapping your code in a transaction is not enough because by default databases do not isolate transactions to the full extent,
which leads to occasional phantom reads. It is therefore necessary to manually raise the transaction isolation level.
The highest level of transaction isolation is called "serializable".

    class QueuedJob < ActiveRecord::Base

      # Job status
      TODO = 1
      PROCESSING = 2
      DONE = 3

      # Returns first job from the queue or nil if the queue is empty
      def pop
        QueuedJob.isolation_level( :serializable ) do
          QueuedJob.transaction do
            queued_job = find_by_status( TODO )
            if queud_job
              queued_job.update_attribute( :status, PROCESSING )
              return queued_job
            else
              return nil
            end
          end
        end
      end

    end
